# Bookstore-Management-System
About :-

I build a Capstone project which is real time Bookstore Management system. It consist of two sections. • Admin section • User section. Admin section aims to help admin to manage the books, such as add books, delete books, update books information (such as price, number of copies available, update category and publisher, manage users). User section aims to help user to search for the required books on the basis of book ID, book name, book title, book author name, book publisher name, and book category. User can add the books in cart and order the books. User can also see the transactions of purchasing which they ever made through this application. User section also contains the profile section in which user can see their details, update their details, and also change their use login password.

Objective :-

This project help me to demonstrate the personal abilities and skills required to produce and present an extended piece of work.
